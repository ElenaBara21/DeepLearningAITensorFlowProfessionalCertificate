#Dense -Dense Layer is simple layer of neurons in which each neuron receives input from all the neurons of previous layer, thus called as dense

#Optimizers are the extended class, which include added information to train a specific model. The optimizer class is initialized with given parameters but it is important to remember that no Tensor is needed

#Loss - We use a loss function to determine how far the predicted values deviate from the actual values in the training data

#Model fitting is a measure of how well a machine learning model generalizes to similar data to that on which it was trained.

# Convergence criterion based on inner products between successive gradients.
